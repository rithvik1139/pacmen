# pacmen

Description: 

This is an animation that allows the user to create a "pacman" on demand with a button click, and then it moves these pacmen across the screen.

How to Run: 

    - go to https://github.com/rithvik1139/pacmen
    - copy git repository
    - open index.html file in web browser

Future Improvements: 

The next step in this repository would be to add background elements that can give an environment for the pacmen movement. With additional improvements a small pacman minigame will be possible.
